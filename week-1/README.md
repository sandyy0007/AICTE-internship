# Tree Species Classification using Leaf Images

## Project Overview
We are working on a *Tree Species Classification system* using leaf images to identify tree species automatically based on their morphological features.

## Work Done Till Now
1. Selected *Tree Species Classification* as our project topic.  
2. Collected a *dataset of leaf images* containing multiple tree species.  
3. Performed *image preprocessing* including resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise removal.  
4. Extracted *basic features* such as shape, texture, and vein patterns from images.  
5. Implemented a preliminary *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model for classification.  
6. Trained the model on the dataset and conducted *validation to check accuracy*.  
7. Analysed *misclassified outputs* to understand and improve model performance.  
8. Prepared *accuracy and loss plots* to visualise training results.  
9. Started *documenting methodology and results* for our project report.  
10. Planned remaining tasks: *report finalisation, PPT preparation, and GitHub code upload*.

## Next Steps
- Complete final *report writing and proofreading*  
- Prepare the *presentation slides*  
- Upload *all code and results to GitHub* before submission
